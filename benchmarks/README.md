# Benchmarks

This folder is the performance and cost record of the package: what adopting it costs in time and
money, how each function scales, and where the cost comes from. It is built entirely by
[`internal-package-contract`](https://github.com/MaverickCER/internal-package-contract): the package
supplies **what to run** (an input), the contract **stresses it through ten sizes, measures it, checks
the big-O and prices it**, and writes a **report** and a machine-readable **result** (the output).
Nothing in this folder implements timing, statistics or reporting.

## Three suites, three hot paths

repo-contract is a check-execution engine, so its performance-sensitive surface is internal. Each suite
benchmarks its own source (`src/`, run through `tsx`) -- reaching into the repository the way a unit test
does, not the way an external consumer imports it:

| Suite                                                                    | What it measures                                                                                                                 | Unit of `n`       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| [performance-checks](performance-checks/BENCHMARKS.md)                   | `runChecks`: scheduling and process orchestration. Every check spawns a real, empty process, so the cost is repo-contract's own. | configured checks |
| [performance-policy-evidence](performance-policy-evidence/BENCHMARKS.md) | `buildEvidence` and `runPolicies`: pure in-memory evidence assembly and policy evaluation, with quiet and chatty tool output.    | check results     |
| [performance-api-contract](performance-api-contract/BENCHMARKS.md)       | The API-contract engine (load, normalize, classify with type-assignability) that gates every release.                            | exported symbols  |

Two ladders stop short of 10,240 and say why in their report: the checks suite stops at 2,560 (each
check spawns a real process) and the API-contract suite at 1,280 (each size compiles a real TypeScript
package and runs API Extractor).

## Commands

```sh
npm run benchmark                   # all three suites -> results.json + BENCHMARKS.md in each
npm run benchmark -- --quick        # smoke test; never commit its output
npm run benchmark -- --only <id>    # run a subset while developing
npm run benchmark:check             # validate the suite's documentation; measures nothing
```

## The input: `suite.mjs`

A suite is plain data plus the functions to run. Import the package's real functions and describe
the arguments to give them at size `n`; the contract does the rest.

```js
import { defineSuite } from "internal-package-contract/benchmark"
import { parse, validate } from "../dist/index.js"

export default defineSuite({
  package: { name: "my-package", bundleFiles: ["dist/index.js"] },
  workload: { unit: "record", description: "One record in the collection.", typicalN: 640 },

  endToEnd: {
    purpose: "What routing one operation through the package adds over a bare function.",
    baseline: { description: "Empty function, no package.", call: (n) => n, input: (n) => [n] },
    withPackage: {
      description: "The same work through the package.",
      call: parse,
      input: (n) => [makeInput(n)],
    },
    variables: [{ name: "records", how: "swept", description: "The tier axis." }],
  },

  functions: [
    {
      id: "validate",
      name: "validate",
      why: "...",
      poorPerformanceMeans: "...",
      expectedComplexity: "linear",
      complexityReason: "...",
      variables: [{ name: "records", how: "swept", description: "The tier axis." }],
      call: validate, // the imported function under test
      input: (n) => [makeInput(n)], // its arguments at size n  ->  validate(...input(n))
      inEndToEnd: { callsPerOperation: 1, description: "Once per operation." },
    },
  ],
})
```

| `package.name`, `package.bundleFiles`                                   | yes / no | The package, and the shipped files whose size is reported.                                    |
| `workload.unit`, `workload.description`, `workload.typicalN`            | yes      | What one unit of `n` is, and the size the cost summary quotes (one of the tiers).             |
| `tiers`                                                                 | no       | The size ladder; defaults to `20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280, 2560, 5120, 10240`.            |
| `endToEnd.purpose`, `.baseline`, `.withPackage`, `.variables`           | yes      | The total-impact comparison with empty or minimal functions on both sides.                    |
| `functions[]`                                                           | yes      | One entry per function. Each is documented (below) and runnable.                              |

| `variants[]`                                                            | no       | Named alternatives (cache hit/miss, input shapes), each measured over the whole ladder.       |
| `tiers` + `tiersReason` (per function)                                  | no       | A shorter ladder for a function that cannot take the largest sizes, with the reason.          |

| `why`, `poorPerformanceMeans`, `expectedComplexity`, `complexityReason` | yes      | The documentation. `defineSuite` rejects missing or placeholder text.                         |
| `variables[]`, `notCovered[]`                                           | yes / no | Every variable that could change the cost (swept / variant / fixed) and honest gaps.          |
| `inEndToEnd`                                                            | no       | How often one end-to-end operation calls the function, for the attribution section.           |

`expectedComplexity` is one of `constant`, `logarithmic`, `linear`, `linearithmic`, `quadratic`,
`exponential-or-worse`. Return a value that depends on the work (the contract keeps it alive so
nothing is optimized away); return `timed(ms)` only when an operation is timed elsewhere, such as a
child process.

## The output: `results.json`

`results.json` has three parts. The shape is fixed (`schemaVersion` 3) and checked on every run by
`validateResults`, which `internal-package-contract/benchmark` also exports.

```text

           cost            the typical and largest sizes used for the headline numbers
```

Because results are not comparable between machines or runs, history and pull-request summaries look at
**change over time on comparable hardware** and at **changes in growth class**, never at one absolute
number. See [READING-BENCHMARKS.md](READING-BENCHMARKS.md).
