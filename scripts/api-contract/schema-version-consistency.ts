 * A new, separate, deliberately narrow pass run in addition to the main compatibility classifier.
 * For every exported interface present in both baseline and current that has a member literally
 * named `version` with a numeric or string literal type: if any *other* member of that interface
 * changed (added/removed/type-changed) but the `version` member's own literal value did *not*
 * change, this is a genuine internal defect -- a schema-versioning literal (per this repository's
 * own convention, documented in VERSIONING.md) that should have been bumped to reflect the shape
 * change and wasn't. This is the one category of finding that can make the policy fail even though
 * it's otherwise advisory (see policy.ts) -- it represents forgetting to update a schema-version
 * literal, not a "not released yet" false positive.
 *
 * Purely structural (an exported interface + a literal-typed `version` field), not a hardcoded
 * name check against specific interfaces, so it generalizes to any future versioned schema.
